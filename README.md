Access to the real datasets is provided [here](). It contains:

 - [__Wadi As-Sirham case study__](https://github.com/mmontesinosanmartin/changepoint_article/tree/master/realdata/crops/data): Detecting the transformation of bare land into cultivated areas from NDVI time-series (1986-2019). The analysis focuses on three agricultural fields where farmers start growing crops in 1991 (`imgs_roi_str.RData`), 2001 (`imgs_roi_mid.RData`), and 2013 (`imgs_roi_end.RData`), i.e. at the beginning, middle, and end of the obervation period. `RData` files contain `RasterStack`s with annual composites of the maximum NDVI derived from surface reflectance satellite imagery captured by Landsat 4-8. 

 - [__Zaca wildfire case study__]()

The `R` code to reproduce the analysis is provided [here]().
