Access to the real datasets is provided [here](). It contains:

 - [__Wadi As-Sirham case study__](https://github.com/mmontesinosanmartin/changepoint_article/tree/master/realdata/crops/data): Transformation of a desertic area into irrigated croplands. The analysis focuses on three fields that start with the agricultural activity at the beginning (`imgs_roi_str.RData`), middle (`imgs_roi_mid.RData`), and end (`imgs_roi_end.RData`) of the time series. Each `RData` file contains a `RasterStack` with the annual NDVI image composites over the period 1986-2019.  

 - [__Zaca wildfire case study__]()

The `R` code to reproduce the analysis is provided [here]().
